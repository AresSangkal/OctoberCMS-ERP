        <p>It is with great pleasure that I take this opportunity as Chief Executive Officer

            of Gulf Consolidated Contractors Co.(GCC) to share our immediate short and

            mid-term plans as we move forward in our new managementâ€™s vision.

        </p>

        <p>

            Meticulously conceived and consistently organized, GCC is the result of multiple

            and simultaneous mergers of long-established Saudi Arabian construction companies.

            Our 60 year history includes continuous kingdom involvement in the major disciplines

            of industrial construction: civil, structural, mechanical instrumentation,
            electrical

            instrumentation, and specialist pipeline construction activities. We look forward to

            maintaining and enhancing the proud history of our constituent companies as

            partners-in-success.

        </p>

        <p>

            Our objective over the next five to seven years is to convert GCC from its present

            [mainly construction related activities] into a full service entity, including:

            engineering, procuring, constructing and a project-management company. The ultimate

            goal is to focus our efforts toward establishing GCC as a leading EPC/PM.

        </p>

        <p>

            In order to achieve this challenging goal, we intend to build a strong and

            technically capable high-level engineering division, to serve as the backbone

            of our company. This capability will be fully supported by a strengthened
            procurement

            division; thus allowing us to undertake mega-multi-discipline projects in the near

            future.

        </p>

        <p>

            We have a collective commitment to ourselves, clients, shareholders and the local

            community, to not only earn a profit and expand business, but also to gain the
            respect

            and professional recognition of our peers.

        </p>

        <p>

            Thank You,

        </p>
